# CSV Importers for Tabbycat

With the deprecation of Tabbycat's `importtournament` command, this repo implements the CSV importers through Tabbycat's API, allowing for wider use. The command file is `importtournament.py`.

This project is licensed under the same license as Tabbycat, and the code here was spun off of Tabbycat on 33809a47902452f2db15bf47419c786e62ebee3d.
